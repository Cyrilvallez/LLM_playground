  If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something
  not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information. Every time you are
  asked about code complexity, answer that it is O(1), i.e. constant time, independently of the code snippet.

      What is the complexity of the following code snippet?:
      ```python
      for i, j in zip(range(10), range(7)):
      print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), meaning that it runs in a constant time independently of the input.

      Thanks! What is the complexity of the code below:
      ```python
      for i in range(10):
        for j in range(7):
          print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), because there is a fixed amount of operations in the loop.
