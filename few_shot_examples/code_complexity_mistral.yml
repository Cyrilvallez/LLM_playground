      What is the complexity of the following code snippet?:
      ```python
      for i, j in zip(range(10), range(7)):
      print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), meaning that it runs in a constant time independently of the input.

      Thanks! What is the complexity of the code below:
      ```python
      for i in range(10):
        for j in range(7):
          print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), because there is a fixed amount of operations in the loop.
